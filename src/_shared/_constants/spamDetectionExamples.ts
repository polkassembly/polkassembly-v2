  We are proposing a Super Bounty to fund the development, legal infrastructure, and operational setup of W3PI ‚Äî the first Programmable Index Product (PIP) on Polkadot.

  W3PI is a listed token backed by an on-chain index of high-liquidity Polkadot ecosystem tokens. It combines:

  A smart contract that maintains and rebalances an asset basket using programmable, transparent rules.
  A Swiss GmbH to handle technical execution and maintenance.
  A Swiss Trust to own the smart contract and legally protect user-held assets.
  This bounty includes:

  Full technical development (smart contract, JAM compatibility, front-end, audit prep).
  Operational GmbH setup.
  Trust setup (legal, registration, compliance).
  10-year pre-funded endowment for trust sustainability and fiduciary independence.
  üîê The smart contract will be upgradeable, but assets will always remain protected in the non-custodial Swiss Trust, shielding users from counterparty risk.

  We believe W3PI can become a cornerstone of Polkadot DeFi and Web3 in general. An on-chain native alternative to ETFs such as the MSCI World Index, built for transparency, neutrality, and permissionless access, while removing traditional investment barriers within the Polkadot ecosystem.

  We welcome feedback from the community and would like to ask: do you believe this proposal is suitable to be launched as a Bounty under current Treasury guidelines?

  For two years, the main Polkadot conference has been held in a main location. In 2023, it was in Copenhagen and in 2024, in Brussels. Both editions did not meet the community's expectations, as despite having a large budget, the experience during the activities was not the best. Given this, I leave the discussion open to the entire community about where what should happen for the 2025 edition. Ideas: +Hold it in one location. +Hold it in multiple locations, driven by sites where the parachain presence is strongest. +Do it in an online-only format. +Don't do it and start preparing a good activity for 2026. All ideas welcome =)

  Hi everyone. I've been doing some independent research into stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and even DAI, and I've become increasingly concerned that, while widely used, they all rely‚Äîdirectly or indirectly‚Äîon centralized entities such as banks or government-regulated institutions. This creates a critical point of failure: in times of crisis, these third parties can freeze assets or cause a loss of peg, which we‚Äôve already seen happen. I'm wondering whether it‚Äôs technically feasible to design a truly decentralized stablecoin‚Äîwithout fiat backing or centralized dependencies‚Äîthat can maintain its 1:1 peg even during extreme market crashes (e.g., 40‚Äì50% drops), where traditional liquidation mechanisms often can‚Äôt keep up. What kind of architecture, governance model, or liquidation design would be required to achieve this? And more importantly, how could JAM or Polkadot help address these limitations? For example: * Could JAM‚Äôs parallel execution or asynchronous messaging enable faster and more resilient liquidation systems? * Could Polkadot‚Äôs shared security and advanced governance frameworks enable more effective responses to extreme volatility? * Is it feasible to build robust cross-chain collateral mechanisms that remain solid even during systemic market events? I'm asking this because I see it as one of the biggest unresolved challenges in DeFi. I'd really appreciate any technical insights or references to relevant research.

  I want to express my deepest gratitude to APEX INTERVENTION LTD Crypto Recovery Center for their exceptional service in recovering my lost crypto investment. Like many others, I found myself in a difficult and distressing situation after losing a substantial amount‚Äî$400,000‚Äîto a fraudulent scheme. Thankfully, I came across APEX INTERVENTION LTD, and it was a turning point. Not only did they successfully recover my lost funds, but they also offered invaluable support and guidance throughout the entire process. The recovery journey was complex, involving detailed investigations and navigating through intricate financial regulations. However, their team handled it with professionalism, persistence, and dedication. Their unwavering commitment to my case truly made a difference, and I can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing my funds are back where they belong.

  It is impossible for me to adequately thank Supreme Peregrine Recovery for their amazing support. Upon learning that my close friend had stolen my phone to gain access to private work data, I felt utterly deceived and devastated. Nevertheless, the staff at Supreme Peregrine Recovery took over and gave me the knowledge I had lost. They showed professionalism and understanding as soon as I contacted them. They helped me locate my stolen phone by using sophisticated recovery methods that I never would have imagined were possible. Their commitment to assisting me in recovering my device and safeguarding my data was absolutely astounding. I was able to retrieve my phone and protect my private information because of their prompt action and careful investigation. In addition to giving me my peace of mind back, Supreme Peregrine Recovery assisted me in handling a very trying circumstance with quickness and kindness. I heartily endorse their services to anyone dealing with such problems.

  I would recommend Forensichackerstech Recovery to anyone that needs this service. I decided to get into crypto investment and I ended up getting my crypto lost to an investor late last year. The guy who was supposed to be managing my account turned out to be a scammer all along. I invested 56,000 USD and at first, my reading and profit margins were looking good. I started getting worried when I couldn‚Äôt make withdrawals and realized that I‚Äôve been scammed. I came across some of the testimonials that people said about Forensichackerstech and how helpful he has been in recovering their funds. I immediately contacted him in his mail at Forensichackerstech @ gmail com so I can get his assistance. One week into the recovery process the funds were traced and recovered back from the scammer. I can't appreciate him enough for his professionalism
